<p>The official name of the Trig Point is: Observatory East.</p>

<p>Serial number: TS number not allocated.</p>

<p>Last inspected: No Data.</p>

<p>Elevation: 46m.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This was restored in its original position but is of historical value only..</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A trig point (also known as a Trigonometric Station) typically consists of a black disc on top of four metal legs or concrete pillar, resembling a navigation beacon. It is also accompanied by a metal disc, which is located directly below the center point of the tripod or on top of the pillar itself.<br />
<br />
Trig points are generally located at the top of hills or points of prominence in the landscape. Many provide unique views and challenges, with some being difficult to get to.<br />
<br />
These points were regarded as valuable to surveyors, providing reference points for measuring distance and direction, and assisting in the creation of maps.<br />
<br />
To log a find on the Geocaching Australia website, you will need to include a picture of the trig point, along with your GPS receiver and (preferably) yourself. You are encouraged to leave a description of your journey in your log to help others in finding the trig point.<br />
<br />
The original collection of trig points has been sourced from Geoscience Australia and may contain inaccuracies.<br />
<br />
Please respect local laws and regulations when searching for trig points. If you believe that a trig point is located on private property or in a dangerous location, you may archive the cache, by clicking on Log this Cache and place an "Archived" log on the Geocaching Australia website.<br />
<br />
If you feel that you can add to the description of this trig point or adjust the difficulty / terrain ratings, please feel free to edit this cache and amend the information suitably. Vandalism of the cache description or other information will result in your account being terminated.</p>

<groundspeak:text>#GA454 - 15:55; I was out on a caching mission around the harbour today and headed back up to Observatory Hill to pick up this trig and a nearby multi.  Certainly plenty of muggles about too.  I not only located this cache, but found another nearby which looked suspiciously like an old trig too (see photo).

<groundspeak:text>Just realised I hadn't logged this one.  I got the answers to all the questions on 5 July, on a caching trip around this area with bikerbuddy &amp; Canary, and emailed them to the CO the following day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bikerbuddy helped me find most of the spots needed, but neither of us could find one &amp; had to ask Canary what it was we were looking for.  When he pointed it out, we felt like idiots  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_redface.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Embarassed&quot; title=&quot;Embarassed&quot; /&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>In town today walking around the Quay for work so there was time for a spot of caching. Unfortunately couldn't find the GC trad at this location but managed the virtual, answers sent for confirmation. Then after the history lesson had to carry on walking around all the way over the Darling Harbour. Thanks PPE. Now I am based in town I will have to try for your Hyde Park virtuals as well.

<groundspeak:text>#GA149 - 17:10; I have overlooked this cache any number of times during visits to Sydney, but made up for it today.  I had shown the geohoney around here earlier in the day and provided a tip for dafid from WA when I spotted him checking out the garden near GZ looking for the GC nano located here.  We came back this evening and gathered the required information which was subsequently sent off to the CO who came back with a green light to log.  TFTC and the history lesson PPE  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Found while staying in Sydney for work, this one was around the corner from my hotel. Loved the history in this little tiny park, which was still quite alive late at night when I swung by. Fortunately no one was interested in the guy writing stuff down and taking photos. Unfortunately, the one of me and the anchor is average at best. TFTC Purplepeopleater!</groundspeak:text>

Great place to spend some time, but not around lunch time as it is very popular with the office workers around.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>It took me a while to figure out which building the thing would be attached to. At first I thought it was on top of the railway station awning as there was a wierd electonic-looking thingy there. But no, I did locate the real thing a few minutes later!</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:long_description html="true"><![CDATA[<p>The <b>Archibald Fountain</b>, properly called the <b>J.F. Archibald Memorial Fountain</b>, widely regarded as the finest public fountain in Australia, is located at the Northern end of Hyde Park. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="300" height="225" alt="" src="http://www.sydney-city-directory.com.au/op-page/op-listiings/Archibald%20Fountain.JPG" /></p>
<p>The fountain resulted from a bequest by the founder and editor of The Bulletin, J.F.Archibald, who stipulated in his will that:</p>
<p class="DoSBlockquote"><em>"a proportion of his estate should be devoted to the creation of some beautiful bronze symbolic open-air memorial by a French artist, commemorative of Australia and France having fought side by side for the liberties of the world. … such memorial to take the form of an electrically lighted fountain to be placed if possible in the Botanical Gardens Sydney or if not in some suitable place in one or other of the public gardens of Sydney."</em></p>
<p class="DoSBlockquote">Archibald specified that it must be designed by a French artist, both because of his great love of French culture and to commemorate the association of Australia and France in World War I. He imagined its civic design and ornamentation developing to rival his dream city Paris. The artist chosen was <a title="François-Léon Sicard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-L%C3%A9on_Sicard">François-Léon Sicard</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To claim this cache take a photo of yourself and or GPS in front of the fountain and answer the following questions:</p>
<p>a) When was the fountain unveiled and by whom?</p>
<p>b) What is represented by the figures on the three plinths radiating from the central column? (Some research may be required)</p>
<p>c) Who stands on the middle column of the fountain?</p>
<p>d) Name at least 3 animals that are sculpted into the fountain.</p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>Today was another day by bus, and as such I walked through the park again. Yesterday I logged a different fountain and today I saw this huge one. It's very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While researching the plinths, I saw that the Wikipedia was vandalized and fixed it in on the way there. CITO &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

715 Km from home.&lt;br /&gt;
Part of our self-guided walking tour through Hyde Park, The Domain and the Botanic Gardens.&lt;br /&gt;
From Museum Station it took over 3 hours to get to this cache (yes, not even half way through the park). &lt;br /&gt;
What a fantastic piece of art work. I think I had been here 30 years ago but in the rush of youth didn’t appreciate what was here. Thanks for the reason to revisit this wonderful place.&lt;br /&gt;
We took nothing but memories and left nothing but footprints.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The co-ords were good and we found the answers easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for the cache Purplepeopleater.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>A rare city visit and I recalled PPE had this virtual nearby. On the way, I found two Macquarie statues that I'd not seen before, as a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;
At the fountain I squatted and twisted to read each plaque through the water streams. I was joined by others at times who wondered what I was doing and then got interested in the whole theme themselves. I think we all had a bit of fun here. Thanks PPE.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Work took me nearby today for a quick job, and I had some time to walk around Hyde Park before I headed back to the office. Quite a nice day to stroll around and grab these 3 from PPE, delays in logging as I kept leaving the sheet of paper in the office. Photos to come as soon as I can work out how to get them off the iPhone or upload, as the old XP computer doesn't recognise it now. Thanks Ross for the hides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Had some dramas with this one as one sign that may or may not have been useful was fenced off by tree trimmers, and had to read the info through the falling water, but PPE confirmed my answers.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Well this was a popular spot today, with lots of people out for a stroll &amp; enjoying the sunshine. For question d, I was tempted to add &quot;dog&quot;, because of the dog that was swimming in the fountain, and clambering onto the plinths, to fetch the sticks being thrown in there. He was having a lovely time.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>#GA146 - 09:50; Located this one on a weekend in Sydney with the geohoney.  I was on my morning walk and took the opportunity to bag a few of the GCA virtuals sitting at the top of the listing of closest caches on the GPSr when I'm in this part of the world.  I was amused by another statue further to the north which I passed on the way to this one, which was adorned with a traffic cone crown.  Hope the miscreants were sober when they undertook the coronation, but probably not  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_think.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Think&quot; title=&quot;Think&quot; /&gt;  Once at GZ, all of the required information was available with a little effort, although gathering some of it strained the eyesight a little  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_redface.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Embarassed&quot; title=&quot;Embarassed&quot; /&gt; Logged with CO OK.

<groundspeak:text>It's always a pleasure to walk through Hyde Park. The war memorial is amazing and perfect for times of quiet reflection and the statues are stunning. As there aren't very many gc.com caches in downtown Sydney we decided to pick up a few GCA caches as we were at it, which was great as they provided an indepth look into the statues of Hyde Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This statue/fountain is immaculate.  It's huge and definitely one that all the brides were using for their wedding photos.  Mrs THR was amazed at such amazing artwork.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>I was visiting Sydney for work, and got my hands on a train pass, so decided to make my way into the CBD to do some GCA caches. I gathered the clues without too much worry. A young couple were having their wedding photos taken in a spot I needed to access, so I waited a few minutes, and the coast was clear. &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>This fountain reminded me of a certain children's book by Pamela Allen that I'll be interested to go back a read now. I didn't see any ducks in the water today, but I did enjoy hearing two groups of musicians trying to out perform each other on opposite sides of the fountain. From the little I heard, it seemed pretty clear that the Beatles cover band was beating the gospel folk group.</groundspeak:text>

I've often stopped to look at this fountain, today was time to actually look at all the element &amp; figure out what they all were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

<p>This bronze sculpture of a boar is named 'Il Porcellino' and was donated to the people of Sydney by The Marchesa Fiaschi (Clarissa) Torrigiani of Florence, Italy on 16 December 1968. It was in honour of Clarissa's father Thomas and brother Piero, who both worked as surgeons at Sydney Hospital.</p>
<p>The statue forms a water feature/fountain which people drop coins into. The money collected is donated to local hospitals. During the year he is dressed in various garlands and head costumes.</p>
<p>More information can be found on the <a href="http://www.sesiahs.health.nsw.gov.au/sydhosp/ilporcellino.asp">NSW Health website</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So come down and rub his nose, drop in a coin, make a wish and log a find. But before you do, you must email The Spindoctors with your answers to the following questions. Include a photo of Il Porcellino with or without you after you submit your log.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
    <li>What street is Il Porcellino looking down?</li>
    <li>Name two types of animals at the base of the scuplture?</li>
    <li>Who was the Town Clerk when the sculpture was presented?</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck. </p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>#GA162 - 13:10; I was in Sydney with the geohoney, geoteen and friend, so while they were indulging in some retail therapy, I'd made my way over to gather the information I required to log a couple of caches nearby at Mrs Macquarie's Chair. On the way back to the CBD, I also stopped by to make the find on this cache.  Sadly, I think I've now completed the City Animals series &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/stabby.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Stabby&quot; title=&quot;Stabby&quot; /&gt; which I've thoroughly enjoyed doing over several visits to the city since my caching adventures began.

<groundspeak:text>I walked by the other day and it occurred to me that this was likely to be one of the City Animals. Not knowing whether it was, and if so what was required, I photographed myself with Il Porcellino and GPS and looked over him quite carefully. I can answer the first two questions easily from memory. The third, I think, will need a revisit - unless I can make out the info from the photos...</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>I'm in Sydney for a few days, and like to add a couple of City Animals to my finds each time I come down. I love the series, and they are far more exciting than looking for soggy micros hidden about the metal structures of the city. &lt;br /&gt;

Found piggy without too much drama. People thought I was a bit of a freak trying to photograph myself with him and my GPSr! Always funny to see the conservative reactions on some peoples faces. If only they knew what they were missing!&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Trim was a black cat with white paws and chest, born on the ship <em>Reliance</em>, during its voyage from Cape of Good Hope to Botany Bay in 1797. He quickly became a favourite of explorer Matthew Flinders and joined him on <em>Investigator</em> as it circumnavigated mainland Australia in 1802. He survived the shipwreck of the <em>Porpoise</em> on Wreck Reef in 1803, but disappeared a few months later while imprisoned on the island of Mauritius with Flinders who had been accused of spying by the French. Flinders believes Trim was stolen and eaten by hungry slaves.</p>
<p>The statue that sits at this location was unveiled in 1996 and crafted by sculptor John Cornwell. Trim's story appears in Bryce Courtenay's novel <em>Matthew Flinders' Cat</em>. You can also find more about <a href="http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/famous/trim.html">Trim at the Purr and Fur website</a>.</p>
<p>To log this find you must email The Spindoctors with your answers to the following questions. Include a photo of Trim with or without you after you submit your log.</p>
<ol>
    <li>What is Trim the statue sitting on?</li>
    <li>In which compass direction is he facing?</li>
    <li>Who is he looking at (standing behind)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck.</p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>I'm enjoying this series, doing one here and there as I visit Sydney occasionally. This was rather cool, given the location and theme, and Trim soon divulged his secrets.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>This was Mrs THR's second day in Sydney and we were enjoying our walk around Sydney. After visiting Circular Quay we walked up here on our way to Hyde Park. Dr THR knew this statue well but didn't remember seeing the feline.  The background information this cache provided was rather insightful. TFTV The Spindoctors</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Another visit to Sydney and a nice walk from the botanical gardens to Hide park had us passing a few more virtuals. My parents were with me an didn't even know I was caching! Love the idea behind this series and wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot more animals around?&lt;br /&gt;

Love this sort of cache. Tupperware gets tedious sometimes. Nice to swap it up with a few virtuals every now and then - especially when they are little treasures with an interesting history. Thanks again, Spindoctors!</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Another good opportunity to keep up my Marathon event for Geosportz. I took the train an extra 2 stops this morning and walked up to find Trim. It was freezing! My gps had me all over the place with the tall buildings but I had a pretty good idea where I ought to end up so all was good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It took me a bit of time to spot Trim and he seemed to be pretty well frozen to the spot this morning as the sun had not yet reached him &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Laughing&quot; title=&quot;Laughing&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

I then almost sent them to the CO, before the power company knocked on the door and said they had to shut off power for an hour.&lt;br /&gt;

I had an unexpected day off work, so we came into the city to look at bookshops &amp; find a few caches.  And I had to add one more from this cute series to my found list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was a worthwhile addition to the series, a lovely little statue of a remarkable little cat.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some time recently I briefly had a travel bug in my possession which featured Trim, it had a goal of circumnavigating the world. Hopefully it will do as well as the real Trim  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;

Easy to walk down the main trail, a couple of turns and then just the last 50 odd metres down the footpad to the ledge where the trig is.   Stunning views...just stay away from the edge. &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Quite an easy one to find as the communication towers can be seen from some distance. Once parked just follow the track east to the end then you will see a track to the left, follow it to the power pole. There is a rough track to the trig to your right.  As Wilbert67 advises this one is not fenced. Fantastic views from here, great spot.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>One of the best Trigs around! To get there keep following the road, even when it turns away from were your GPS is pointing and go down a little track of about 15 meters at the end. Watch out there is a 100+ drop just 1 meter from the Trig and this one is not fenced!&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:long_description html="true"><![CDATA[<p>A very strange sculpture indeed!</p>
<p>The <b>Frederic Joseph Walker Memorial Fountain</b> is in <a title="Hyde Park, Sydney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_Sydney"><font color="#0645ad">Hyde Park</font></a>, <a title="Sydney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"><font color="#0645ad">Sydney</font></a>, Australia is is a magnificent two part memorial sculptured by Gerard Havekas (1925- ), one part is a huge Sydney sandstone sculpture of three figures depicting 'The Labours and Beauty of Pioneering Mankind'. The other part is the fountain which is a very large circular saucer sitting on a pedestal about 600mm above an egg shaped pond and covered in hundreds of handmade coloured ceramic tiles, no two the same. The water spouts about 2 metres vertically and then falls back into the dish which overflows as a curtain of water onto natural round river stones in the pond. The water is blown by the wind giving a sense of restlessness and continuity but there is also a sense of serenity as it is set in a grassy area with a backdrop of shrubs leading many park visitors to sit and relax.</p>
<p>The family of Frederic Joseph Walker donated the memorial to be placed in Hyde Park, Sydney, Australia:</p>
<p>It was opened on 15th February, 1961.</p>
<p>The sculpture’s design was as a result of a competition held by the City of Sydney Council under Lord Mayor Harry F Jensen. One of F. J. Walker’s sons-in-law, Sir William Herbert Northam was, at the time, a Councillor on the City of Sydney Council. The competition was won by Mr. Gerard Havekas, a Dutch sculptor who lives in Sydney having moved to Australia in 1950.</p>

<groundspeak:text>When the buses replace the train, that is when you change your path. And when you change your path, you see new things. Like this one. Sometimes I walk through the park, but it is a straight line towards the big fountain and this little fountain was not seen until today. Thanks for bringing me here!</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Wandered through Hyde Park on the way to work this morning and checked out the Not so Hidden Hyde #1.  It was an amazingly quiet spot at 0710 this morning, with lots of action going on at all points of the compass but not at GZ.  Checked the answers and sent them off.  Our thanks to the CO for a fun virtual and quick response.&lt;br /&gt;

716 Km from home.&lt;br /&gt;
Part of our self-guided walking tour through Hyde Park, The Domain and the Botanic Gardens.&lt;br /&gt;
From Museum Station it took over 3 hours to get to this cache (yes, not even half way through the park). &lt;br /&gt;
A strange sculpture indeed&lt;br /&gt;
We took nothing but memories and left nothing but footprints.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The co-ords were good and we found the answers easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the cache Purplepeopleater.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Work took me nearby today for a quick job, and I had some time to walk around Hyde Park before I headed back to the office. Quite a nice day to stroll around and grab these 3 from PPE, delays in logging as I kept leaving the sheet of paper in the office. Photos to come as soon as I can work out how to get them off the iPhone or upload, as the old XP computer doesn't recognise it now. Thanks Ross for the hides.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>It's always a pleasure to walk through Hyde Park.  The war memorial is amazing and perfect for times of quiet reflection and the statues are stunning.  As there aren't very many gc.com caches in downtown Sydney we decided to pick up a few GCA caches as we were at it, which was great as they provided an indepth look into the statues of Hyde Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr THR had been to Hyde Park many times, but this statue never resonated.  We were both amazed to see such a strange looking work of art here.  The closer we looked the more amazed we were, especially with the fountain.  The meaning in this artwork is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>What a great walk....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parked at the end of Sir Joseph Banks Drive (hope that is what it is called at this end) and after driving over many many speed bumps, I arrived at the end of the road.    Then took the walk along the cliff tops...and that was fantastic.   Great day to be out here and well worth the time it took to get to the lighthouse.    Could go on forever about the views, but really, head down and check it out for yourself.   Very worth while..... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Today we walked from Kurnell to the lighthouse, started at 10:00 and were back at 15:00. Always a nice walk, even with the muddy puddles!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a previous logger said: Lighthouses are cool.&lt;br /&gt;
With regard to the trig at the top, isn't that a lightning deflector? Maybe yes, maybe no. I leave it to more knowledgeable people to answer that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you would take the sneaky path north west from here, you had a beautiful view of the area with Kurnell and the Sydney CBD in the distance.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>1310 Nice to get a lighthouse and a trig at the same time. Took a few false starts on some the tracks on the way from the North. I was surprised as I turned up the track directly below the lighthouse to have a cyclist go past me.&lt;br /&gt;
All looks good here. Great views today - except looking in the direction of the archived/dismantled trig. I don't know who would want to go there.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>I got around to doing this Trig at last after getting off the bus at the top of the refinery at Bridge Street (no bus stop closer) I walked back along Captain Cook Drive to Sir Joseph Banks Drive and all the way down to the coast, found the track and started towards the lighthouse, the track does disappear from time to time but eventually you will see the lighthouse and find the small track off to the left hand side and battle your way through the vegetation to reach the top.&lt;br /&gt;
Great spot, a shame the access is not being maintained, or the coastal track either!&lt;br /&gt;

The views from the top of the lighthouse would be great, but there is very limited view from the base due to bush/tree growth. However the walk along here is well worth it for the great coastal views.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>NO ACCESS - This was over the fence and out of reach as far as I could tell, so probably needs to be archived, but I will leave it for another person to verify first, and they can dhave the honour of archiving it then if inaccessiblity is confirmed.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>When my family visited the city when I was little, my dad always told the story of how he remembered, when he was younger, the AWA Tower being the tallest building in the city. Today as I was traveling into the city on the rivercat I looked up and saw the AWA Tower tucked away amongst all the other buildings, I was able to pass on this piece of history to my children. &lt;br /&gt;
I have always thought it was an amazing structure, so different to everything around it.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>#GA163 - 13:20; I was in Sydney with the geohoney, geoteen and friend, so while they were indulging in some retail therapy, I'd made my way over to the botanical gardens, then via another virtual to pick up a few of the caches I'd yet to log in the CBD, this one among them.  Headed towards GZ and soon had the trig in sight.  After taking the obligatory happy snap, it was off to meet up with the girls and headed out of the CBD on another retail expedition in Drummoyne!

<p>Serial number is: TS10135R.</p>
<p>Last Inspected on: September 18, 1975.</p>
<p>Elevation is: 114 metres.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The trig was spotted on Google Earth.  It is on top of the large water tank on Jannali Avenue in Sutherland.  Also visible from Grand Parade. </p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;">A Trig Point is a virtual cache which requires a cacher to locate the Trigonometric Station at GZ.</span></p>
<p>A trig point (also known as a Trigonometric Station) typically consists of a black disc on top of four metal legs or concrete pillar, resembling a navigation beacon. It is also accompanied by a metal disc, which is located directly below the center point of the tripod or on top of the pillar itself.<br />
<br />
Trig points are generally located at the top of hills or points of prominence in the landscape. Many provide unique views and challenges, with some being difficult to access.<br />
<br />
These points were regarded as valuable to surveyors, providing reference points for measuring distance and direction, and assisting in the creation of maps.<br />
<br />
To log a find on the Geocaching Australia website, you will need to include a picture of the trig point, along with your GPS receiver and (preferably) yourself. Long distance / telephoto type pictures are against the spirit of this cache. You are encouraged to leave a description of your journey in your log to help others in finding the trig point.<br />
<br />
The original collection of trig points has been sourced from Geoscience Australia and may contain inaccuracies.<br />
<br />
Please respect local laws and regulations when searching for trig points. If you believe that a trig point is located on private property or in a dangerous location, you may archive the cache, by clicking on 'Log this Cache' and placing an 'Archived' log on the Geocaching Australia website.<br />
<br />
If you feel that you can add to the description of this trig point or adjust the difficulty/terrain ratings, please feel free to edit this cache and amend the information suitably. Vandalism of the cache description or other information will result in your account being terminated.</p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>Spotted this one Google Earth last night and as I was going to be down in &quot;the Shire&quot; today I published it and a few others.  Easy to spot from The Grand Parade but I went down to Jannali Ave to take the photo as you can't stop up there.  There's an odd golden modern trig-like structure on a nearby building.  Might be a lightning rod.  See photo.</groundspeak:text>

<p>Islay was a pet to Queen Victoria during the early years of her reign. The dog was most likely named after the Scottish island, which means the 'Jewel of the Hebrides'. It would seem quite appropriate given his was a Skye terrior.</p>
<p>According to the plaque behind the statue:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Islay was a favourite pet of Queen Victoria; whenever he saw his royal mistress, he would sit up and beg for a biscuit. He was often sketched and painted by both Queen Victoria and Sir Edwin Landseer, he painting master.</p>
<p>The statue sits on top of a wishing well. Money collected by the wishing well is donated to The Royal NSW Institute for Deaf & Blind Children.</p>
<p>To log this find you must email The Spindoctors with your answers to the following questions. Include a photo of Islay with or without you in the picture with your log.</p>
<ol>
    <li>The statue is based on a drawing by Queen Victoria from what year?</li>
    <li>There are a number of proverbs surrounding the statues. In how many languages do they appear?</li>
    <li>Finally, what should you touch before casting your coin in the well and making a wish?</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck. </p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>I can say a lot about these kind of dogs. That I don't like them (very much &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt;, that my aunt had two of them, that a dutch comedian called them [NSFW removed]s. Either way, I'm glad this one is made from a metal and that it is collecting money for charity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While I was there they were cleaning the fountain, so the man who was doing the job was curious on why I was trying to figure out all these things while he was standing there busying a hose...&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>#GA158 - 14:00; My meanderings around Sydney were nearing an end when I happened to be passing this cache on the way to meet up with the geohoney for the trip home.  I have passed this little statue numerous times and hadn't stopped to have a closer look and learn a little more history in the process.  A worthwhile project if I do say so too.  An email to the CO gained a quick response and a green light.

<groundspeak:text>We had just arrived in Sydney and had some time to spare before heading to church.  After checking out the nearby GC.com cache we stopped off to see Queen Victoria and her dog.  This is always a popular stop when visiting Sydney. Mrs THR was shocked when the dog talked but then found him cute.  This was a cute virtual.  Answers sent to the CO.

It's amazing to see this one hasn't been logged for well over a year.  Hopefully I'm back again soon so I can follow the 'virtual' trail around town.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Wink&quot; title=&quot;Wink&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

FWIW, I reckon virtuals have a place in the game for this reason; thank goodness Geocaching Australia still allow them.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_dance.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dancing&quot; title=&quot;Dancing&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Another trip into town for work, but not needing any tools or anything I just caught the train to save money on parking. Walked back from Centrepoint where I was down past the QVB back to Town Hall station. Have walked past this plenty of times before when I worked nearby years back, getting a photo with all the tourists around isn't the easiest. Thanks Darren.</groundspeak:text>

All is well, my half ginger youth spent in the sun not biting back yet. As it was across the road I couldnt ignore Islay any longer, so we went to pay a visit. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Got the info and Zhaoy says the Chinese at least is very well translated. No Lawsy today and the well is dry for repairs but Islay was happy to see us anyway. Did some shopping and Munzing in town then headed home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only one or two of these to go I think! &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Very Happy&quot; title=&quot;Very Happy&quot; /&gt; Cheers SpinDocs!</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>I had always thought of this wishing well as the John Laws wishing well (due to the voice) so it is VERY nice to now be able to think of it as Islay's wishing well &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Very Happy&quot; title=&quot;Very Happy&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>A city event on Tuesday evening took me very close to GZ, so I just had to go looking for this cute little dog even in the rain and the encroaching darkness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And he's still there, sitting up and begging quite near the huge statue of his mistress! And the voice of John Laws survives as well, sounding out over the many tourists, who snap Islay's photo at regular intervals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I only wish I'd had time available to go and track down the other GCA 'virtual' animals around the CBD. Perhaps on another occasion . . .&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>I briefly tried to get close to this one a few weeks ago, but it was dark (and therefore hard to read the plaques), and some chugger was bugging me, so I gave up. This morning the coast was clear, and I was able to appreciate this statue, as well as get the information for the virtual. I am glad I only had to touch rather than kiss the &lt;answer to question 3&gt;, as when my wife kissed the real one she got sick for a week!&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>I was going to do this cache that has been on my radar for some time, however when I got there I was confronted by a massive hoarding around GZ. It seems that work is being done on the site, well not today, it was all locked and no sign of any work being carried out. There is no indication as to how long it will be before the hoarding is removed or as to what is going on. it may be a good idea for the CO to disable this one until the work is finished and checked to see if the clues are still there!</groundspeak:text>

<p>Biggles, who appears to be a Miniature Schnauzer, was a 'loved friend of The Rocks'.</p>
<p>He was often seen riding around on the back of a motor-scooter with his owner Trevor Kelly (a resident in the Rocks), or jumping from balcony to balcony in pursuit of a cat or two. Unfortunately in 1994 Biggles took his last jump in pursuit of a rat.</p>
<p>The statue was commissioned by The Rocks Chamber of Commerce and unveiled by the Honourable Robert Webster, then Minister for Planning and Housing.</p>
<p>To log this find you must email The Spindoctors with your answers to the following questions. Include a photo of Biggles with or without you after you submit your log.</p>
<ol>
    <li>How old was Biggles when he passed away?</li>
    <li>How many years after his passing was the statue unveiled?</li>
    <li>In which compass direction is he facing?</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck.</p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>I was waiting with the family for a friend to pick us up to take us back to the airport to return home to Brisbane and I checked the GPS to see that I was 20m away. I couldn't resist the temptation to duck around the corner and take a couple of quick snaps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I found Biggles and got the snaps and returned with 30 seconds to spare.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>I was nearby looking for some GC caches, and saw this was nearby. There weren't too many muggles around, and nobody seemed too concerned about me taking pictures of the cute little fella or trying to figure out the compass heading with the iPhone. I guess it is less suspicious than reaching under pipes to get mint tins.&lt;br /&gt;

Bikerbuddy &amp; I took a trip to the City on Sunday &amp; wondered around the Rocks &amp; the Botanic Gardens.  Biggles was easily found, we gathered the required information &amp; continued on our walk.  Got home to discover that we could also have found the new additions to this series while we were in the area.  I guess that's another trip back for them now.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Last time I was in Sydney I found one of the Spindoctors’ City Animal virtuals, so this time I decided to seek out another! I had to walk a little further for this one – but I wanted to go to the Harbour Bride pylons to do the Earthcache there. Well this is one cute little statue. It’s in a quiet little corner of The Rocks too. I posed for a couple of photos with the pooch, and got quite a few laughs from a group of  passing muggles. I’ve emailed the answers to the questions in the description. I cant believe how detailed the statue is. Someone spent a lot of time crafting him. Thanks for showing me a nice little spot of Sydney, Spindoctors!</groundspeak:text>

Finished the first appointment to have 40 minutes before the Cockatoo Island ferry so went and found a couple of caches. Then on Cockatoo Island spent 10 minutes taking the photos I needed and had 50 minutes to wait for the next ferry west so got those caches as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, have done some work very close to this little doggie before as we run the radio links that feed the security cameras all around here. In fact I've parked next to him before. So it was an easy walk up from the Quay to get the required answers. Nice to see the locals appreciate the local animals as well. Thanks Spindoctors.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:long_description html="true"><![CDATA[<p>Slowpoke is a little slow.</p>
<p>He heard about this "GeGnome" project, and thought it would be a great idea to participate, and pass off as a garden gnome, to race around the country, between the 1st of December 2010, and the 31st of January 2011.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But of course, Slowpoke is a little slow, therefore only heard about it the day beore the competition ended. But neverless, he's ready to go, go, go! ..slowly!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you need to do.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Find me. Hopefully shouldnt be too hard. I bare an uncanny resemblance to the pokemon called Slowpoke. (But i'm missing a tail, as Bubbles_Baby kept on having issues making it.)</li>
    <li>Log a "Found" log. This is easy!</li>
    <li>Re-hide me! Please dont place me anywhere too difficult and scary.</li>
    <li>Log a "Moved" log, with the new coordinates, and a clue, so the next person can find me!</li>
</ol>
<p>Have fun!</p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>Oh boy... Do I have bad news.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So this evening one of the cubs asked if he could look into the geocache container for the 2nd Caringbah Scouts. No problem, grabbed it from under its hide and showed them what was in it: A badge, a car, a travelbug, an euhm... pieces of rock in a bag and the logbook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While going through the logbook, one of these angles grabbed the bag with rock and starts going through them. At the end four of them have the pieces of rock. One says &quot;there is something in it!&quot; and before I know it everybody is throwing their rocks towards the ground to see if there is more on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So right now I have a bag with GA3078 on it, a log book with lots of names for it and two hands full of rocks...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The GeGnome is beyond repair, but I'm more than happy to send you the logbook in case you want a revival....</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Had been advised that a contingent of moveables were migrating east so set the alarm for 0544 so I could watch the transit of the second brightest object in the night sky. I have seen it on numerous occasions around sunset but never at sunrise. Once it passed I went back to bed so lost the advantage of avoiding the summer heat (forget Autumn, no such season). The migrants had settle in various locations, some with views, so not. This one with. I shall hide it somewhere soon. Thanks to fluffyfish for this boost to my stats. My Magellan performed admirably.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>1st of 13 caches near Googong and surrounding places. These gnomes have been out here for a while, so a rescue had to be done! A nice easy find to start us off. Pretty cool. As some have said, one of the legs has broken off, so we might fix it (if we have time). We are going to Vincentia, NSW on the weekend, so will place it there.

<groundspeak:text>Candy Cane 101 and I went for a walk this afternoon, placing gnomes in this area, according to some very specific instructions by Black Bunny.  We haven't been told why, but we suspect a pattern is emerging.  We also suspect that we were told to do it in a certain way, just to make us cross the creek the maximum number of times en route.  We had fun anyway, and saw a lot of kangaroos and a few brown bunnies.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>We were in this cemetery doing a new multi and thought we had better set Slowpoke free. He's been travelling with me for a few days now, each time with good intentions of parting ways. Hope someone finds him soon - maybe someone doing the multi in the cemetery.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Sorry for taking so long to log that I've got this fellow. My son, who is a mad Pokemon fan, insists that Slowpoke is from Pokemon, and so he wanted to take him with us.

<groundspeak:text>Found this geognome accidentally whilst looking for smitchnstu's cache 'noisy nest' just off Pennant Hills Rd.  Had no idea what it was meant to be until reading the description ...I have to say, apart from the missing tail, it does look a lot like slowpoke!  I'd attach a picture of 'slowpoke the geognome' sitting next to the 'slowpoke the pokemon card' but I'm not sure how to attach pictures in these logs! &gt;_&lt;&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>2 Canberra gnomes kidnapped by the GGG (GNOME-MARE!!! &amp; Mr Bump), with the aide of of a forward observer stationed at Oberon (Heave-Ho) formed the Gnome Liberation Front, and convinced a cadre of gnomes currently resident in the Blue Mountains environment, that their services were required in the ACT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This led to a call being placed by the GLF for a mass extraction of the gnomes and various pickup points were organized.  The gnomes had a long march from their various Lithgow detention points and a few gnomes were left in the region to gather intelligence in case of a need for future pickups.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Look for these gnomes to start appearing in Federal relief agencies as experts on the Flood recovery and CRPS programs.</groundspeak:text>

We are now starting to have gnomes tucked in here, and gnomes popped in there - just as well Vicky is a large vehicle. I still think Slowpoke must be related to pink cats, some where in his genealogy.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>After a lot of travelling through the night, down from the Blue Mountains, I was pleased to find 'Slowpork' again, quite easy to spot under a famous bush, and see that he's still in good shape after last Saturday's extravaganza at Homebush -- still looking very pink. Perhaps it's sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I'm still asking . . . what kind of gnome is he -- really?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it's after midnight now, so maybe it's better not to enquire further . . . At least he didn't turn into a pumpkin . . .&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Having entirely missed him during the great gnome race, I finally encountered this little gnuy at the The Gegnome Project-Post Gnome Get Together at Homebush Bay! He was one of an amazing variety of 42 gnomes in attendance on the day, at Wentworth Commons -- and a few gnome-mad geocachers attended as well . . . The scorching 41 degree temperatures didn't dent our enthusiasm. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to all those battle-hardened gnomes who survived the rigours of the recent competition and our condolences to the owners of those who suffered injuries and/damage or who were finally declared 'missing in action' . . . &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This gnome can now take a very well-deserved break, doing whatever it is that gnomes do when they take well-deserved break . . .</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Headed off with Albida and Mtrax for (another) visit to the Gnome Gnation to see a few new residents.   Although word on the way established a few had already taken off for greener, yet colder, pastures, we continued with our plan and still managed to catch up with quite a few of the recent arrivals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our plan this time was not a mass round up, but that doesn't mean future trips wont include a complete clean out.   Time, and re-enforcements, will dictate future retrieval missions.  &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Blue Mountains GCA trip with Sol de Lune and Mtrax.  We headed off to visit the Gnome Gnation area on Mt Piddington.  We had some bad news on the way up that several had been retrieved yesterday, but we persisted and I managed to find 13 moveables, two GA Trads and two Trigs.  The area up here is amazing.  Dense bush opening out onto huge vistas and quite a bit of clambering to get to some as well.  A great day, but now I have to chase a pile more locally.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Alas I couldn't work out/couldn't remember how to get into the scrub. After all the rain over the last few years the weeds have gone berserk. Parked just up from Gilmore Park &amp; walked down a fair way but no access over the gully. Then drove to the eastern side but no where to park. If its still around after awhile I'll catch the train up &amp; spend more time navigating - too bloody hot today. Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
Today we attended a geocaching event listed on geocaching.com - see the link below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=07dbf66e-c710-427f-8511-d729574b5efc&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now this event was run in conjunction of a couple of Government agencies to try and get families involved in outdoor activities specifically geocaching. Some great prizes were on offer including 3 GPSr's. Many active geocaching teams/families attended volunteering their time and also having the usual chin wag. So after the event and most people had departed 1 of the winning families approached us stragglers for a chat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the course of the conversation Little piggy GA3664 made an appearance and we started discussing moveable caches!  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_confused.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Confused&quot; title=&quot;Confused&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surprise surprise this muggle family then proceeded to tell the little group that they had found an 'owl' some months back but couldnt open it, but thought it could have been a Geocache!  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_whistle.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Whistle&quot; title=&quot;Whistle&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Further discussion on the how/ where it was found and we are 99% certain that Gnignox Gnatalis has been hanging out with these nice muggles and will soon be released back out to play!! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Small world heh!  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_eek.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Shocked&quot; title=&quot;Shocked&quot; /&gt;  Fingers crossed this comes to fruition  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_think.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Think&quot; title=&quot;Think&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>So you decided to fly back out to Ellenbrook and say hi. I couldn't pass up the oportunity to go for a walk to pick you up along with &quot;cache-cache&quot;. It seems you have winged your way around the suburbs nicely since we last met. I may take you for a drive down to the Esperance area at the end of the week. Great to see you again. After 6 months of flying around the Perth region I will let you hang out for a few days and rest.</groundspeak:text>

Hard to believe that's how long since we saw you Gnignox gnatalis. Well picked you up today and will see what adventures you have been getting up to. After spending 3 days resting. Mrs Felix decided it was time to get out and about again. Headed over to this area to find the geocachingaustralia moveable cache- &quot;cache cache&quot; then found a few others nearby. nice park &amp; grab this one.  N.B I lost my write in the rain 'Inka' pen somewhere today if anyone finds it I would appreciate it back.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Wow, this one is huge!&lt;br /&gt;

A quick find after work in a spot where I managed to grab a few caches in about five minutes. Quite a few muggles around but they were all preoccupied with what was happening on the field. Nice to be out caching in the rain again. TFTC! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not quite sure where I'll be able to place it, but will start looking.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>After a very large breakfast Gnignox and I set off on our day of caching. We knocked off a fair bit of mickeydv's FTF finders series and ended up meeting the man himself at our last stop (R0gue) during a cache maintenance run. Since Mick is more of a night owl than I am I decided to let Gnignox go with him for a nap, followed by the night shift. Let's hope he stays clear of those jet engine turbines &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Gnignox Gnatalis had breakfast this morning with gardengorilla and Xinders. It was hard for him to stay awake so he stayed in the car and only came out towards the end, much to the amusement of the muggles in the area. &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Smile&quot; title=&quot;Smile&quot; /&gt;  He has now gone off into the distance with gardengorilla.

<groundspeak:text>What a cute owl. I don't think he was ready to leave yet for we found him enjoying his surroundings under the shade of a tree.  He gave me a little peck on my arm with his sharp beak when I suggested that it was time to travel again.  We climbed one of the towers and watched the sunset and the beautiful colours of the sky.  Will send him travelling soon. TFTC  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_clap.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Clapping&quot; title=&quot;Clapping&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>We found this gorgeous big owl in an excellent hidey spot.  What a beautiful creature he is with such large round eyes!!  I carried him up the tower while the Kat took some pictures of him against the sunset.  (Can't believe I did that for I don't like climbing stairs with gaps ... or going up towers!!) We are giving him 5 stars for he is truly outstanding.

<groundspeak:text>We meet again Gnignox!  Well we did that the hard way. After walking in on a hot day, we managed to find the new nearby GC cache and as we walked back onto the track a &quot;City of Wanneroo&quot; vehicle was coming along. Trying not to look too suspicious, we started to walk back to the car and then completely forgot to look for Gnignox. Once we got back to the car and were about to drive off, a little &quot;light bulb&quot; appeared above our heads as we remembered the other reason for going to this cache, DOH!  So back we walked and upon reaching gz we realised that we had been standing in the shade less than 3 metres from where Gnignox was resting. &lt;br /&gt;
Well I hope you enjoyed the race Gnignox, now it is time to relax and just  fly around at your own pace. Who knows maybe you could visit the friendly folks that released you into the wild. I will move you on shortly when  you are rested and ready. &lt;br /&gt;

Still no luck when Muggles arrived to say what are you looking for? Um..Umm... we lost a tennis ball????**? So... still cannot find Gnignox Gnatalis but after our effort tonight on sunset we can only assume that poor Gnignox Gnatalis has been carried away by the ENORMOUS, PLENTIFUL, Mandurah Mosquitoes!

<groundspeak:text>&lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_lol.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Laughing&quot; title=&quot;Laughing&quot; /&gt; Well Gnignox Gnatalis has been very busy flying to the Northern Suburbs to 'Roost'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is out now, as it is nighttime touring the suburbs display of christmas lights. Quite a few nearby, if you are passing in the evening don't miss the display in Darlington Loop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He will rest up for a while in this 'Winery' estate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do not fear that he is alone as he is very near to a BBQ and playground so some families especially children could be nearby to&lt;br /&gt;
keep him company should he feel lonely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wish you well our friend. Safe travels over the Christmas Period, hope&lt;br /&gt;
you catch up with some Gnome friends soon.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
After getting the snake to move along, Gnostic was nabbed. Thinking about where to move him to. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surprised at the amount of stuff in his cache though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have added a stubby holder &amp; finders card to help him along his way, but took nothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will move him along in the required 2 days.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:long_description html="true"><![CDATA[<p>This gnome is a work of pure evil.  Raised from the depths of the Gnomish Kingdom, he has come to enslave humanity.  The One Gnome to Rule Them All can come in many forms, fishing gnome, gnome under a toadstool, etc.  In this instance he has reincarnated as a mining gnome.  This is particularly pertinent as gnomes are embittered over their forced slavery in mines around the world.  As documented in "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves" (although they were gnomes but incorrectly classified by the human movie makers), they were sent to isolated spots to mine for riches.  Though they saw none of the wealth they generated.</p>
<p>With the Third Gnome of Jerrara now rallying the troops, the One Gnome to Rule Them All waits.  He is encumbered by a small plastic container on his feet.  This means that the gnomes must come to him.  Therefore we must keep this gnome moving.  Do not hold onto him for more than 2 days!  Otherwise the gnomish army may find him and the war to end all wars will begin.  This gnome will mess with your mind.  "Keep me, keep me" he might project a voice into your mind.  But resist at all costs.  Do not be responsible for the destruction of humankind.</p>
<p>This gnome was part of the Moving Cache Race 2010/2011.  He is now an ordinary moveable cache.  Good luck!</p>

<groundspeak:text>The One Gnome to Rule Them All has joined with a group of disenchanted Gnomes in the occupation of this tract of land, the aim being to secede from Australia and create their own independent country.&lt;br /&gt;

A PAF to the last mover did the trick (thanks, alfyboy) and I finally emerged to look in a much easier place, much to Mrs. pjmpjm's relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were on our way back home after yet another foray into emptying nearly 39 years' worth of stuff from the old Dural apartment . . .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyhow, will get 'One Gnome' out into the mountains, where he's apparently needed . . . He seems to be in OK condition, perhaps a little lonely.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>My usual Monday night caching run was delayed due to the recent Christmas festivities so I was able to squeeze a cache run in on the following Wednesday Night. As I was finishing Parallel Universes (GC38vVRA I bumped into Littlemerpip and we decided to catch up later in the evening and hit a few caches to the south.  But before we met up I had to go and collect the unfound gnomes here at Braeside.  There were all looking good and happy.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Candy Cane 101 and I went for a walk this afternoon, placing gnomes in this area, according to some very specific instructions by Black Bunny.  We haven't been told why, but we suspect a pattern is emerging.  We also suspect that we were told to do it in a certain way, just to make us cross the creek the maximum number of times en route.  We had fun anyway, and saw a lot of kangaroos and a few brown bunnies.&lt;br /&gt;

 Don't go looking for him before Saturday the 2nd of July, he won't come out and play until then!</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Dropped this guy off in a nice spot with views.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is hidden in a cave under a big rock that has a fallen dead tree laying across it. Once under the rock he is in a crack on the right hand side (looking at the cave from the downhill side) behind a piece of burnt wood. There are old and current fire trails that will take you to within 30mtrs of the cave, best approach is up the hill from the fire trail on the western side of the hidey hole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terrain rating: 2.5.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>It was a tough job finding a little Gnome in all of this long grass. TF the clues got me close enough or I could have been there for hours.&lt;br /&gt;
Weather permitting we should get a few Km's up tomorrow.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Wandered up this morning having first checked GE to see where the cemetery was &amp; best access. Took second best access but still got there. Would have used the Nuvi but ............Soon found the miner &amp; he was covered in coal dust. He also had a few friends but I threw them out. I then did a tour of this historical cemetery with its ornate &amp; stately graves &amp; sad epitaphs. One grave listed 5 siblings all of whom died from age 4 through to 24 with both parents outliving them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Called into Kiama on the return &amp; then took forever to find a place not over-run with tourists. I selected an area I had previously hidden a moveable. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Decided to go home via the highway only to be stuck in crawling traffic 2Ks from home. If your heading down this way take the Sand Track.   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An enjoyable morning, thanks.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>So for those that worry, this is placed in a cemetery.  It is not hidden in any graves, gravestones, etc.  Do not disturb the cemetery in the hunt.  It is an easy find in an obvious place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not that Tuena needs this warning but some people worry about how caching can affect these locations.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>The first time I did the City to Surf was while I was in school in 1978 - 1981 but I no longer have the bibs from those times, I then did the City to Surf in 2008 &amp; 2009 with Blacktown Aquatic Centre. The image shows my bib number and the singlet that I wore. Halfway through I hurt my calf and had to walk the rest of the way and made it in the end</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>I've always walked the City2Surf. When walking alone, I do it in 2 hours 20 minutes. When walking with others, I am in the back of the pack and end up in less than 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've done it for sure in 2000 and some more years by myself.&lt;br /&gt;
[...at least two times here...]&lt;br /&gt;
In 2005 with GeoDirk in a sling.&lt;br /&gt;
[...somewhere here with HanorahTLG in the stroller...]&lt;br /&gt;
In 2010 with GeoDirk at least for 50% on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011 with GeoDirk walking mostly himself.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2012 with GeoDirk and Hanorah at least for 50% on my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2013 with GeoDirk and Hanorah walking themselves. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay not more carrying for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently I'm hoping to get back to under three hours with the two of them in tow, but since they spend a lot of time sightseeing I don't have my hopes up yet.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>What better way to finish off the GeoSportz Marathon than with a 14.4km Run?! Zhaoy and I only started training for this about 6 weeks ago and were aiming for 100 minutes. Last week we posted 60 mins for a 10km run which had us on track.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today the weather held for great running conditions. Cool, dry and only a bit of wind right at the end. We posted 89:11 minutes which considering how comfortably we did it was a cake walk &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Very Happy&quot; title=&quot;Very Happy&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

Im glad he made me though as it was an amazing experience and I had so much fun. We even did much better than we were planning on. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Best of all when the official results came out in the papaer... I won by 1 second  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_dance.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Dancing&quot; title=&quot;Dancing&quot; /&gt;  hehehe&lt;br /&gt;

<p>Official name of this Trig Station as per NSW Department of Lands is: Kurnell.</p>
<p>Serial number is: TS2771R.</p>
<p>Last Inspected on: February, 1977.</p>
<p>Elevation is: 57 metres.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we were out walking today we spotted a trigpoint on top of a water tower next to that huge prominent golf ball that can be seen from miles away! So we decided to take the coordinates and list it on the GCA website. It's a great place and the area is a super spot to watch the whales when they're migrating.</p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>Trig number 2 for the day, a very enjoyable walk from Sir Joseph Banks Drive and a lot of exploring the many side tracks, many of which end nowhere!&lt;br /&gt;
At least I knew this one had to be there and got the photo to it still was a hot day, the heat haze created by the steel roof over the reservoir is quite visible on the photo as it makes everything blurry.&lt;br /&gt;
Glad I was not there in the middle of summer, it was quite hot enough today.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>I have seen this dozens of times and decided to do some research. There is a trig point on top of the Kurnell Reservoir but the giant &quot;golf ball &quot; is actually an automatic weather station with a Doppler weather radar.&lt;br /&gt;
In March 1999, the Bureau of Meteorology installed an automatic weather station on Sydney Water land beside the reservoir on Kurnell headland.&lt;br /&gt;
The info below is from:&lt;br /&gt;
 http://www.ssec.org.au/our_environment/our_bioregion/kurnell/history/services/weatherwatching.htm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of Sydney's severe weather approaches from the southwest or the south. Kurnell, close to sea level and with an uninterrupted view of the horizon, was chosen for the Doppler Weather Radar installation to provide maximum warning of adverse weather to the heavily populated Sydney region.&lt;br /&gt;
The Kurnell electromagnetic doppler weather radar installation, built in March 1999.&lt;br /&gt;
This Kurnell installation is a meteorological instrument that continuously monitors rainfall and wind fields within approximately 150 km of Kurnell, with greatest detail closer to the installation. The radar emits electromagnetic radiation which is directed upwards into the atmosphere and the information is transferred via telephone line twenty-four hours a day to weather forecasters who use the information for short-range weather forecasting and warning purposes. Identification of severe thunderstorm activity, including information on squall lines and hail, is foremost amongst these activities, although the strength and timing of arrival of southerly busters that periodically affect the Sydney coast can also be determined. Sea breezes too, and other wind changes, are monitored.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The average television set produces a radiation level of 0.3 microWatts per sq cm (Australian Radiation Laboratories figure). Comparing the Kurnell doppler weather radar to a television set shows that the weather-watch radar radiation at ground level is considerably less than that of the average television set.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>After visiting Cook's Rock nearby, it was a short drive and a short walk to get to this location. I probably should have walked further to get to the coast to admire the view, but time was running out so I headed back to the car after the obligatory photo.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the cache!&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>#GA664 - 16:50; Sol de lune and I had discussed a wild trig hunt in the Illawarra quite a while ago and today was the day we tried to bring home the bacon. We had collected a few on the way down the mountain and in to Kiama, before heading north for a DNF in Shellharbour then on to the main section of the Tour de Illawarra. We had now scaled the heights and were close to heading for home when we reached GZ for this aptly named cache.  Sublime indeed.  Not only snapped the trig, but took a few of the spectacular views as well.

<groundspeak:text>Haven't stopped here for years but being down south today was a great chance to view the 'sublime' views and log the easiest and most intact trig we've seen for a while. I think there were 11 coal freighters sitting off the coast and the air was pretty clear.&lt;br /&gt;
Afterwards we headed off to the nearby unfound 'Bulli' trig.  After Sublime it should have been called Ridiculous. &lt;br /&gt;
Outstanding for intactness and views, some of the best in Australia.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>The view from Sublime trig at Sublime Point is, dare I say it, simply sublime. On a field trip with NSW NPWS, we stopped here to check out several walking tracks nearby, one of which has been recently refurbished and well worth checking out as it drops down the escarpment via ladders and stairs, then to simply admire the view on a very clear and crisp winter's day.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Two trigs on my list today so saved the best for last. The NUVI had trouble getting me here big time. Sent me up Bulli Pass then back to Wollongong!! So came back up, ignored it &amp; eventually found my own way (via Appin Rd) where I did a Ueee. We're both navigationaly challenged. Quite a religious location judging by the inscriptions. The view wasn't to bad but the unseasonal weather was creating a great deal of smog. Interesting to see the local council allowing development on the lower escarpment (so far). Well worth a visit.</groundspeak:text>

Track in is a 4WD basher track, we encountered one vehicle before we headed around to the old Madden trig. There's a sealed road just past this trig which must have been for the mine once.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>After some kilometres walking around the Illawarra escarpment, this was the final find for the day. &lt;br /&gt;
There is some lovely bushland walking closer to the escarpment that is worth doing but this Trigpoint is an easy walk from the nearby main road.&lt;br /&gt;
This trig seems somewhat unique in that it doesn't have much of a view! Most tend to be at an obvious high point where this one is dwarfed by the massive Telecommunication towers nearby.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>This trig is located on top of the Sydney Observatory tower. Whilst you cannot climb to the top, as this section of the building is closed to the public, it is possible to get to 11 m of the trig point by standing directly under the tower. The Observatory dates back to 1857 and was used in astronomical and meteorological studies. Prior to this a signal station was located here in 1825 to receive messages from south Head about ships entering the harbour. This hill is the highest natural elevation in the Sydney CBD.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:long_description html="true"><![CDATA[<p>After finding our 3rd cache today at Engadine, Team Beechmere decided to hide their 3rd in return.    M10 and I went to the local hardware shop and decided that a slim blue thermos bottle (only $13) was perfectly suitable for our new cache.   We stuffed it with a small zip-bag, logbook sheets (hastily written), pen, and a couple of very minor swap items (key-ring clip, sealed nailfile).</p>
<p>M10 and I then set off for a local walking track at the back of the Woronora Cemetary. Not finding a suitable hiding place, we were about to give up and go home as it was getting late.  We decided to check out a well defined side track and came across some natural features with some potential places to hide a cache of our size.  Within a few seconds we had found the perfect spot.</p>
<p>This cache can be enjoyed by geo-kids, but please ensure they stay close by.  The bush is thick in places, but the Ground Zero location is close enough to the established path.   Use the hint if you have trouble with a GPS signal.   </p>
<p>Further down the hill, you'll find another well used walking track.  Turn right and it will lead you back up to the playing fields and civilization </p>]]></groundspeak:long_description>

<groundspeak:text>I'd spent New Years Days sitting around doing nothing, and it was tempting to do again today. However, decided to get out caching instead with Tally the geo-dog. After some stops at Alfords Point and Menai this was the last one for the day. I've often wondered about all the little paths in this area, there must be some history to them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After getting to GZ, finding the cache took longer than it should have, oh well. Great spot and a nice walk to get in here. &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Been in this area a few times before caching. It's a great little pocket of bushland &amp; so peaceful this afternoon...Or was that because we'd managed to lose the teenage kids at scout camp this weekend lol?! Anyway, we approached from the lower track and enjoyed the walk. Nice to see a different container too.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:short_description html="true"><![CDATA[A Trig Point is a virtual cache which requires a cacher to locate the Trigonometric Station at GZ.]]></groundspeak:short_description>
<groundspeak:long_description html="true"><![CDATA[<p>A trig point (also known as a Trigonometric Station) typically consists of a black disc on top of four metal legs or concrete pillar, resembling a navigation beacon. It is also accompanied by a metal disc, which is located directly below the center point of the tripod or on top of the pillar itself.<br />
<br />
Trig points are generally located at the top of hills or points of prominence in the landscape. Many provide unique views and challenges, with some being difficult to get to.<br />
<br />
These points were regarded as valuable to surveyors, providing reference points for measuring distance and direction, and assisting in the creation of maps.<br />
<br />
To log a find on the Geocaching Australia website, you will need to include a picture of the trig point, along with your GPS receiver and (preferably) yourself. Long distance / telephoto type pictures are against the spirit of this cache. You are encouraged to leave a description of your journey in your log to help others in finding the trig point.<br />

<groundspeak:text>Having &quot;gone over to the dark side&quot; with my first GCA cache &quot;Sykes by night&quot; two days ago, I suppose that logging a Trig Point means that I have gone over totally and without restraint.

And what meaning is &quot;TFTC&quot; when there is no actual &quot;C&quot;?  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_doh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Doh&quot; title=&quot;Doh&quot; /&gt;   Ah, well...</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>This morning we climbed The Nut, what a steep path! The chairlift would have been easy but at least we got our daily exercise!  We'd probably done about half the track when we spotted the trig. A nice looking dead tree made for some cool photos. It's fenced off but right next to the trig so you can get close. &lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Full on spring weather today - sunshine, scuddy showers and wind! You can see in the pic the strap of the Garmin flying like a flag! Enjoyed  the walk around the nut - the downhill, out of the rain parts especially! Coming down on the chairlift was a bit nail biting though - once we reached the lip of the nut and started to drop over the steepest side, the wind caught the chair and we certainly got up a bit of a sway!  &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/eusa_pray.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Pray&quot; title=&quot;Pray&quot; /&gt;  I have to confess I was quite glad to disembark at the bottom.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>We took the easy way today (rode the chairlift) as one of us is trying to recover from a virus which has greatly reduced walking and climbing stamina - the walk around the loop on the top of The Nut in strong winds was more than enough for today. Staying at home was not a option as &quot;cabin fever&quot; had set in and, after all, there were three caches to be completed on The Nut!</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Not sure if it's good form to log a cache you've created, but since the Trig Point was already there I thought it would be fair &lt;img src=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/pics/smilies/icon_razz.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Razz&quot; title=&quot;Razz&quot; /&gt;</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>We were discussing Trig Point caches whilst walking around &quot;The Nut&quot; completing an earth cache when we come across this trig point.  Great views from here.  There is a car park close by.  You can catch chair lift or walk up.  They are in the process of building walk ways but at the moment the ground can be quite rough in spots.</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>Well I found this one when i did the Earth-cache on the 27/08/08, while on holidays in Tasmania.&lt;br /&gt;
I remember having to walk up the path to the top,(terrain rating would be 4).&lt;br /&gt;
I had to stop twice for a rest break on the way up. The great thing about that is that it is all down hill on your way to the carpark.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank GCA</groundspeak:text>

<groundspeak:text>We found this one while on holidays doing the EarthCache and other traditional one up here. Took the photo with the trig so now we are logging the find. A fantastic view from here. We walked up the steep track instead of taking the chair lift.&lt;br /&gt;

<groundspeak:text>Once upon-a-time, when we were still muggles, we toured around Tasmania in the winter. It was cold but fine weather. We had a great time. The kids learn the value of the YHA network and we had some great accommodation in Burnie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We took the drive to Dismal Swamp. What a great mane to attract the tourists. The stainless steel slippery dip was a fun way to get into the forest (it is all fun till some one gets concussion).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We loved the climb to the top of the nut. I know the exact date of the find so we are making a retrospective claim. I hope some time to return and update the claim.</groundspeak:text>
