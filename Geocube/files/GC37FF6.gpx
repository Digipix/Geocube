          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">On a short business visit I found myself with a Sunday afternoon to spare (the morning was dedicated to watching Women's World Cup matches).  what better way than to explore the neighbourhood where I am staying than through caching?  I particularly enjoyed this cache, revealing a number of interesting and educational pieces of art-work. I had to back track to one piece that was being used by children and to another where I had missed a number. Sat and did my maths watching the fountain and proceeded to the final.  At first, i was dubious (and without a hint or sum check very much in the dark).  But fortunately it was quiet and after some scratching the well concealed container was revealed).

I had a fun walk down the 'City Walk' paying more attention to the features that I walk past every other day.  I only made one error, but that was obvious and I found myself at GZ and was very happy to see the cache.  A pity this feature is not what it used to be.  Oh well.

I enjoyed the wall very much and looking at some art that I did not even know existed!  Coords worked out easily, but at the GZy iPhone GPS went haywire under all the trees. I took a leaf out of a previous finder's experience and headed for the path and back in again which led me straight to the cache!  There appears to be a discrepancy between written and e-logs that the CO might want to look into :-). Day #117 of caching, dropped a pathtag in, and a favourite point!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a fabulous multi. I enjoyed my leisurely stroll from art work to art work. I came into Civic to meet up with other people, and came early so I could get this cache. Some people LOVED to criticise Jon Stanhope for the artwork that now decorates our city, but I think they are wrong. The artwork has helped enliven and make our city a more interesting and exciting place. It's just a shame that the city area cannot be even better, but the Mall has sucked the life out of it. Allowing that to expand was a mistake, but not the artwork. A favourite for a lovely stroll. TFTC Pacmania.</groundspeak:text>

Pagan quickly had the container in hand. The cache contained a lot of water and logbook was quite wet. A great multi with a nice set of clues. We really enjoyed the artworks and thankfully muggle numbers were moderately low which always helps.
